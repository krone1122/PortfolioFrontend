        <div class="subheading mb-3">The Cincinnati Insurance Companies</div>
        <p>Worked on multiple different C# apps and Angular apps, many of them I was the sole maintainer of. Managed multiple interns including a team of 6 interns tasked to build an Angular app for the Resource Management Organization.</p>
        <p>
          Developed a console app in C# that automated the comparison of database snapshots and XML files, and outputted the results into an excel spreadsheet. This was a manual process that could take up to a week, but with my app, it became an approximately 2 minute, "set and forget" process.
          See Projects page for a better description.

          Half way through my Developer II tenure I was placed on the number one project in the company; an angular app designed to issue insurance policies to small businesses known as Cinergy<span>&#8480;</span>. I have done many things in the Cinergy<span>&#8480;</span> space from backend API work, to frontend UI work, to owning a data transformation process utilizing XSLT.
