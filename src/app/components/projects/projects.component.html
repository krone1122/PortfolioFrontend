      <div class="subheading mb-3">The Traveler of Mundor</div>
      <p>The Traveler of Mundor is a Top-Down 2D RPG developed soley by me. It has been my passion project for the last 4 years. But it's roots run much deeper than that.</p>
      <p>
        It started out as a text based RPG game that I developed in 2015 as my first tutorial into C#. Following <a href="https://scottlilly.com/learn-c-by-building-a-simple-rpg-index/">Scott Lilly's Guide to C#</a> I eventually had this neat little RPG game with an inventory, quests, different locations to visit, and even combat.
        But it just wasnt enough. Over the next year I expanded the game, adding chests, NPC's, unique items with custom functionality, and more locations including 7 dungeons. After I started adding the 8th dungeon, I took a step back from the project and examined it hard.
        I decided that the project was just in a state of disrepair. The code was messy, it was cumbersome to do things, and honestly the whole game could probably have been beaten in an hour. So what did I do? Started from scratch of course!
      </p>
      <p>
        I created an entirely new project, called it 2.0, and began to rewrite everything. Not only did I rework the code to make it scalable and have a sleeker UI, but I began to implement even more features like multiple save files with a start menu, as well as expanding the content 10 fold.
        Over the next few years I worked on this version of the game, expanding on the content as I worked through reworking every aspect of the code. I took breaks here and there, but I pretty much put the project on hold when I started my final year of college. Over the next year I spent all of my time working on Virtual Marketplace, my capstone project.
        While this did put a hold on developing my game, it taught me something else instead. It taught me how to use Unity.
      </p>
      <p>
        A few months after I graduated, I decided to take the knowledge I had learned and use it to turn my game into what I also envisioned it to be. Following this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4vbr3u7UKWp0iM1WIfRjCDTI03u43Zfu">series of tutorials</a> by MisterTaftCreates,
        I once again did I what did in 2015. Along the way through the tutorial, I started adding my own content. First it was chests, then NPC's and quests; before I knew it I was developing my game without needing the tutorial anymore. I started creating all the UI's, implementing unique items, and I even rewrote my entire backend engine.
        Before in both versions 1 and 2, the data for the games objects (NPC's, quests, chest contents, items, equipment, etc...) was all in code. I wanted to break away from that use data files to store the data, and then have an engine that could read any file and output it to a common type that the game could then access easily.
        I ended up transferring all the game data into XML files and wrote some code that could read any of them and create each node as a custom class I call WorldObject. This WorldObject is essentially an extended Dictionary where the key is a string and the value could be anything; a primitive type, an object/list of objects, or even another WorldObject.
        In order to manage these files I created another WinForms app called GameDataEditor (see below) that allows me to edit the XML files in a GUI format, without having to sift through them in Notepad++.
      </p>
      <p>
        4 years later and I am still developing this game. I am currently working on implementing the 3<sup>rd</sup> dungeon and hope to have it completed within the next couple months. If you wish to check out the game, I have a version that is ready to be tested, send me an email and I will send you the download link.

      <div class="subheading mb-3">Virtual Marketplace</div>
      <p>
        Virtual Marketplace was my college capstone project. Developed by me, and two others, it was a virtual reality shopping center. The idea was to merge the convenience of online shopping, with the tangibility of an online store. I was the sole software developer on the team so it was a lot of work developing the suite of applications we had for our project.
        Not only did we have the VR application, which was done in Unity3D with C#, but we also had a website that would track your transactions made within the application, as well as a handful of other applications to make everything run smoothly. Continue on to learn more about each component of this project.
      </p>
      <p>
        As stated Virtual Marketplace was ultimately a VR application built using Unity3D and C#. In order to get Unity to utilize the VR headset we had to download some 3<sup>rd</sup> party packages. Namely, we used Steam VR and VRTK (Virtual Reality Toolkit). However, there was custom code that needed to be written, and thats where I came in.
        I was able to write the code to hook up our logic to the different buttons on the VR remote. In order for our logic to work though, I had to come up with a bit of a creative solution. You see, being a bit of a novice developer at the time I struggled adding a 3<sup>rd</sup> party DLL to our project, specifcally DLL's needed to do database operations.
        Because of this, I ended up writing a console app that I called Virtual Marketplace Database, or VMDB for short.
      </p>
      <p>
        VMDB was a console application that came bundled with the Virtual Marketplace download. It was designed to accept database commands, in the form of an argument string, from the Unity application and then run those commands. If the Unity application needed to retrieve data, VMDB would build an XML file of the results. The Unity application would be listening for that file and once it was there, would act upon it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I mentioned earlier we also had a website that was used to track the transactions made within the Unity application. Built using C#, ASP.NET MVC, effectively, the website was a full on customer portal. Users were asked to create an account where they could enter in all their information such as personal, shipping and even billing information. From there they could then access the full site which featured a few sections about the project and its designers,
        as well as the section to track your transactions and see purchase receipts. The website also served as the download point for the application itself. Which brings me to the final application in the suite, the Virtual Marketplace Launcher.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Launcher program was my way of getting the user to sign into their account so they could then shop in the Unity application. Rather than build a UI in Unity and force the user to use the VR remote to sign in, I built a wrapper program that simply prompted the user for their username and password on startup. If the entered credentials authenticated against our database, the Unity application would then launch and the customer's ID number would be passed forward.
        All in all it was a simple application that served a simple but crucial purpose to the project.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the end Virtual Marketplace was a success. It was well received by our professors, peers, and consumers and we received an A on the project for our efforts.
