Run the command ng build --output-path docs --base-href /PortfolioFrontend/
  This will build the app to the docs folder, and then set the base href correctly.

Once its done, go into main.js and change the assets path for the me.jpg from ../assets/img/me.jpg to /PortfolioFrontend/assets/img/me.jpg.
  (Will need to figure out how to automate this so I dont have to manually do this every build)

Once complete, commit your changes to the branch and merge them into protected/master. The site is setup and should automatically reflect new changes.

Remember that the DOCS folder is what gets served so its only whats in there, not whats in the branch that matters.
